# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-Through-Live-Camera.

## Project Description

This project implements an Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to detect and classify emotions in real-time from facial expressions captured through a live camera feed.

### Key Features:

1. Emotion Classification: Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and neutrality.
2. Real-time Processing: Analyzes emotions from live camera feeds in real-time.
3. Feedback System: Provides tailored content (e.g., guided meditations, motivational quotes) based on detected emotions.
4. CNN Architecture: Utilizes state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks for accurate emotion recognition.

## Significance

This project contributes to advancements in:
- Human-computer interaction
- Psychological research
- Potential clinical diagnostics

By focusing on non-verbal communication cues, particularly facial expressions, this system aims to bridge the gap in understanding human emotions, which play a crucial role in effective communication.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN implementation)
- OpenCV (for image processing and camera integration)
- Keras(for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN))
